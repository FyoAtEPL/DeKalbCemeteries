# Woodlawn Cemetery

Woodlawn Cemetery has two sections:
- **[Woodlawn Cemetery](https://github.com/FyoAtEPL/DeKalbCemeteries/blob/main/cemeteryFiles/Woodlawn.md "Woodlawn Cemetery")**, the primary cemetery
- **[Southlawn Cemetery](https://github.com/FyoAtEPL/DeKalbCemeteries/blob/main/cemeteryFiles/Southlawn.md "Southlawn Cemetery")**, a subsection

FYO - Should I make a disambig page for RL/WL/SL/AM? or just WL/SL?
