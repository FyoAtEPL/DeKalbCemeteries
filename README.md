# DeKalb County Cemeteries Index

## Project Overview

This is an index of cemeteries and gravesites in DeKalb County, Indiana. Our goal is to make an index that is easily accessible by patrons of the Willenar Genealogy Center, a service of Eckhart Public Library. When complete, it will consist of an online version and a printed edition available for reference at WGC. This project is a born-digital approach to documenting locations.

### Purpose of this Github repository

This repository is the current collection of files and page drafts for the index. All files are not final, I am adding and updating information on a weekly basis. When finished, it will be made into a website freely accessible by the public.

## Notes on dates (MAKE THIS BETTER - Fyo) 
**Date Established** indicates a date that has been given for its establishment/incorporation or the date the land was deeded. **Earliest Burial** indicates the earliest date found on a tombstone. Unless otherwise indicated, these dates have been sourced from SHAARD. **Earliest Burial** and **Earliest Date on a Tombstone** may be different. **Earliest Burial** is the first person to be buried in this location, which may have been before the cemetery was officially established. **Earliest Date** might not be the first person to be buried, as they may have been moved from a previous location.

## Notes on numbers
**January 23, 2023 -** Currently, the number of graves reflects my count in books at WGC. This may not be correct due to human error. It also may not reflect the number of actual graves or lots, or the number of headstones (e.g., multiple people may share a stone, stones may be missing/damaged etc.). I will verify these numbers with sextans before final publication. The present counts (as of Feb 2023) are approximations based on my counts.
