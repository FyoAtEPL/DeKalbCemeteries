# DeKalb County Cemeteries

### Project Overview

This is an index of cemeteries and gravesites in DeKalb County, Indiana. Our goal is to make an index that is easily accessible by patrons of the Willenar Genealogy Center, a service of Eckhart Public Library. When complete, it will consist of an online version and a printed edition available for reference at WGC.

#### Purpose of this Github repository

This repository is the current collection of files and page drafts for the index. All files are not final, I am adding and updating information on a weekly basis. When finished, it will be made into a website freely accessible by the public.
